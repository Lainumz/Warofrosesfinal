          <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
          <p>The Wars of the Roses were a series of conflicts that unfolded in the latter half of the 15th century in
            England. These battles revolved around the power struggle between two rival branches of the Plantagenet
            family—the houses of York and Lancaster—for control of the English throne. The origins of this conflict lay in
            the aftermath of Edward III's reign, with both factions claiming legitimacy through their descent from him.
            <br>
            <br>
            The conflict started with the First Battle of St Albans, where forces aligned with Richard, Duke of York,
            clashed with those loyal to King Henry VI. This initial confrontation set the stage for a prolonged series of
            intermittent battles, political maneuvering, and acts of treachery that spanned over several decades.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Wars of the Roses were unleashed by a complex web of factors, including weak leadership, financial
            instability, and deep-rooted power struggles. These elements profoundly impacted the political, social, and
            economic landscape of England during this tumultuous period, shaping the events that unfolded over the
            subsequent three decades.

          </p>
          <h2 class="title1"> Why do these wars receive the name of Wars of Roses?</h2>
          <p>The name “The Wars of the Roses” was posteriorly originated after the wars finished. It was romantically
            created by the novelist Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832). Walter Scott found a source of inspiration in William
            Shakespeare’s novels, hence he popularized the use of rose symbols in his play Henry VI (1597). In the play,
            he brought up a scene in which the noblemen choose a red or white rose to represent the cause they are
            reinforcing the grounds of the Temple Church in London. By the latter part of the 18th century, historians did
            recognize the Tudor Rose's symbolic reconciliation in Walter’s historical book Anne of Geierstein, whom he was
            always referring to the encounters as "The Wars of the Roses." The colors play an important role in the
            meaning of the given name since the white rose represents the York family and the red rose represents the
            Lancaster family. </p>

          <h2 class="title">Causes & Antecedents</h2>
          <p>For that time being, the Plantagenets were and had been on the throne for generations. They were highly
            spoken of for the transformation of England under their power, remarkably, the signing of the Magna Carta.
            However, their dynasty and the French one had been interlinked from previous times, but for the
            well‑established rivalry between the House of the Lancastrian and the House of York. It wasn’t until the reign
            of Henry VI that this would set off a chain of unfortunate events.
            <br>
            <br>
            Taking a look into the context of these wars, we can quickly notice the context of crisis that England was
            undergoing, due to the defeat they suffered in the Hundred Years War. The economic expenses and weak
            leadership of the king, compounded by decisions attributed to his insanity, ultimately led to popular revolts.
            Anarchical ideals would begin to spread as taxation would become higher. A different system emerged, wherein
            individuals paid the monarchy in exchange for their magnates' services, replacing the feudal levy. This new
            arrangement was termed "Bastard feudalism," a term coined by historian Charles Plummer in 1885. The latter
            caused a power struggle owing to the retinues of the magnates becoming more influential than the monarchy.
            Furthermore, this period can be seen as a transitional moment in which towns were growing bigger, society had
            broken ties with the land, and the labor market was evolving into something more flexible.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="@/assets/lancaster.webp" alt="Lancaster and york"
              style="width: 600px; height: auto; display: block; margin: auto;">
            <br>
            In medieval times, the monarchy was often seen as a divine institution, believed to be sanctioned by God. The
            legitimacy of a monarch's lineage was rooted in the belief of a divine right to rule. However, this belief did
            not prevent challenges to the throne if the people believed the ruler was unfit. The Plantagenet Family was
            divided in both Houses of Lancaster and York, and there was more than one possible heir to the throne. For
            Instance, the monarch Henry VI did overthrow Richard II to become the King, illustrating how power within the
            monarchy could shift between different branches of the royal family. In the long run, this would lead to
            conflict over succession.
            <br>
            <br>
            A lack of confidence in the leadership of Henry VI was building up among the established noble families
            because the king was appointing inappropriate nobles to roles within the court. Influenced by Queen Margaret
            of Anjou, the king, in a state of mental illness, favored young and inexperienced nobles rising into senior
            positions, upsetting established noble families like the Duke of York, who also belonged to the royal lineage.
            Thus, the treasury management was made by these newly appointed nobles in the remaining areas they had after
            the Hundred Years War; Calais and Normandy. Both did suffer serious deficiencies in the 1440s and 1450s. This
            climate of instability explained the creation of a Regency Council headed by Richard of York, who quickly
            began to take action. By surprise, Henry VI recovered and reversed the progress that was being made and forced
            Richard of York into exile. This decision would be the final blow to the beginning of War.

        <section id="yorks-revolt" class="scroll-section">
          <h2 class="title">York’s Revolt (1455 - 1460)</h2>
          <p>The Duke of York, in the pursuit of revenge, sent between 3000 and 7000 troops to St. Albans in London, where
            the force of Henry VI was waiting for them. It resulted in a significant Yorkish victory, due to the fact that
            York’s men found the monarch and took him as prisoner. The death of most of York's rivals and the custody of
            the king was a very favourable situation for Richard of York; it was in that setting that his faction regained
            their position of influence.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a period of stability, York’s allies such as the Earl of Warwick gained prominence. The consort of the
            monarch saw Warwick as a threat and tried to cut his supplies off. Nevertheless, she was forced to support him
            due to a French attack, so he could protect the kingdom. In the recovery of King Henry’s mental faculties,
            York was taken out of his position as Lord Protector.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the monarch attempted to restore peace, the Earl of Warwick was plotting attacks against various fleets and
            setting up international connections thanks to his position in Calais, which later would pay off. In
            retribution, he was sent to London to undergo investigations with others, like York. Warwick would leave his
            obligations to join the Yorkist forces. An unforeseen attack took place at Blore Heath, where the Yorkist
            army, although they were outnumbered, somehow managed to force Lancastrians to retreat. A betrayal by
            Warwick’s Calais troops was waiting for him when he arrived in England, this spread out the Yorkist army. In
            spite of that, the latter kept control of Calais. The Lancastrians, who recently had a victory at Ludford
            Bridge, held a Parliament to begin the process of declaring York guilty of treason. This scared some Lords of
            losing their titles and property.
            <br>
            <br>
            After some more defeats for the Lancastrians, Henry VI was again captured by the York and brought to London,
            to the Tower garrison to give up control of that location. The Parliament declared the doubt of succession
            “above the law” and the solution they found was the Act of Accord (1460), which states that after Henry VI
            death, the throne would pass to the Duke of York, instead of to the son of the monarch. Ultimately, in the
            Battle of Worksop, which was a defeat for the Yorkist, York and his allies were captured and killed. But none
            of that mattered, because Richard of York’s son, who recently turned eighteen, inherited his father’s claim to
            the throne.

        <section id="ascension" class="scroll-section">
          <h2 class="title">Ascension and reign of the Yorkist Edward IV (1461 - 1483)</h2>
          <p>After the Battle of Northampton (July 10th, 1460), that resulted in a Yorkist victory, Margaret of Anjou
            (House of Lancaster) decided to make a deal with the King of Scotland for an army and then she striked against
            the Yorks, ending with Richard of York’s and his son Edmund’s lives. Afterwards, she beated back Warwick in
            the 2nd battle of St. Albans (February 17th 1461), getting back her husband Henry VI and returning to the
            North, leaving London without a king.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, Warwick met with York’s elder son Edward in London, with the plan to talk with the bishop of London
            aiming to claim the throne. The bishop asked the people of London and the people decided to claim Edward as
            their king, making him Edward the IV. Given this coronation, the king and Warwick decided to strike back
            against Lancaster, leading to the Battle of Towton (March 29th, 1461) which resulted in York’s victory.
            It all seemed like the war ended but when Warwick was trying to marry Edward with a French princess he
            discovered that Edward married a widow in secret. Then, Warwick felt betrayed and given the fact that Edward
            was ignorant of politics, he left the House of York and decided to stand with the House of Lancaster, so he
            contacted Edward’s brother, George and sailed to France in order to make an alliance with Margaret.
            Later on, Warwick invaded England in 1470, forcing Edward to flee with his younger brother Richard, duke of
            Gloucester. Afterwards, Warwick placed Henry VI on the throne and befriended England with France in order to
            war against Burgundy. Charles of Burgundy then decided to help Edward (York) to take back the throne,
            therefore Edward invaded England in 1671 in a battle that caused Warwick’s death. On that exact day, Margaret
            returned to England and decided to confront Edward in the Battle of Tewkesbury (May 4th, 1471) where the only
            son of Henry VI and Margaret was killed at the age of 17, his father was also killed soon after the battle and
            her mother was taken captive. The French King paid for her return to home

          <h2 class="title">Richard III reign and defeat by Lancastrians (1483 - 1485)</h2>
          <p>Again, it seemed like this was the end for the war with the York victory but when Edward suddenly fainted in
            1483, his younger brother Richard claimed that due to Edward’s secret marriage with the widow, none of his
            children were legitimate. Therefore, he claimed the throne, turning into Richard the III. No one else claimed
            the throne until Henry Tudor, a Lancaster descendant from Edward III, who, in 1485, confronted the king in the
            Battle of Bosworth Field (August 22nd, 1485), resulting in a victory for Edward, who killed Richard himself.
            With the objective of ending this war, Henry VII married the daughter of Edward IV, Elizabeth of Yor uniting
            the two roses (Lancaster and York) into the House of Tudor.

          <h2 class="title">Aftermath</h2>
          <p>Alongside the end of the war, the Medieval era also ended in England and between some of the consequences of
            the Wars of the Roses we can find:
            <br>
            <br>
            − An increase in the power of nobles compared to the Crown during the wars.
            <br>
            <br>
            − Assassination and violence were more normalised when using them as political tools.
            <br>
            <br>
            − The wars killed half the lords of 60 noble families, leaving half of the nobility.
            <br>
            <br>
            − The creation of the House of Tudor.
            <br>
            <br>
            − Inspiration for a lot of future works, which include, for example, some by William Shakespeare or Game of
            Thrones.

        <section id="conclusion" class="scroll-section">
          <h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>To summarise, The Wars of the Roses were battles that happened consecutively between the House of York and
            the House of Lancaster, both from the Plantagenet lineage, to determine who the rightful heir to the British
            throne was after Edward III’s death. The main element that caused the war to detonate, however, was the crisis
            the country was undergoing and how weakly the king, who at that moment was Henry VI, managed it. Both families
            had roses that represented each house, which is why the war receives its name. After many battles, betrayals
            and changes of throne, it seemed like the House of York had won, but a final battle with a Lancaster victory
            marked the end, which was later on sealed when Henry VII from the House of Lancaster married Elizabeth of
            York, uniting both houses into one, the House of Tudor.
            <br>
            <br>
            This Civil War conveyed a change in so many cultural, social and economic aspects that are nowadays seen as
            core elements to the United Kingdom or that are well renowned in history. The Tudors went on to be largely
            known historically mainly due to Henry VIII, famous for his six wives and for separating the Church of England
            from the Vatican’s power. The nobles had heightened power in comparison to the Crown, and the wars inspired
            highly consumed media nowadays, from Elizabethan plays by William Shakespeare like Henry VI, Part 1; Henry VI,
            Part 2; Henry VI, Part 3; and Richard III; or famous TV shows like Game of Thrones.

            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, The Wars of the Roses consolidated British culture and its end marked a union between houses and the
            birth of a new one, which would later on be very significant.
